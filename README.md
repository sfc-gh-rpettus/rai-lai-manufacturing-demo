# rai-lai-manufacturing-demo

This provides a working example of using an agent to orchestrate with Snowflake native apps as tools. The example is based on LandingAI and RelationalAI in an automobile manufacturing setting to be able to assess defects and the impact from a supply chain.

This currently uses the [orchestration-framework](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/orchestration-framework) package developed by [Alejandro Herrera](https://github.com/sfc-gh-alherrera) (alejandro.herrera@snowflake.com) as a prototype. So you will need to leverage the agent_gateway of this project. If using SiS, load agent_gateway into a Snowflake stage.
